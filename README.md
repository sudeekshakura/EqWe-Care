# EqWe Care - Because we care!

At EqWe Care, our mission is to provide equal, quality and uninterrupted health care for the deprived and distressed sections of the society. Our applications are strategically made to ensure immediate assistance to emergency patients by providing a one click consolidated summary of difficult to access historical medical reports. Additionally, we understand the inadequate care that people rely on due to lack of awareness on affordable insurance programs. So, through our platform we provide well assessed insurance programs that maximize benefits at surprisingly affordable plans. As a service provider and SaaS platform we bridge the unfortunate health care gaps.



## Methodology

There is a latency in maintaining a concise and quick one click away health record of patients. Itâ€™s always a hassle to compile older records and provide prompt care especially in unresponsive emergencies and for senior patients. Our platform uses multimedia EHRs of patients and runs them through Gen AI to convert features to descriptions. LLMs are used upon the descriptions to provide concise summarization of the records. Multimedia reports including MRI reports, lab diagnostic reports and patient vital information through csv files are pre processed and loaded on MongoDB and accessed by Intel Cloud Developer and React to develop models and build front end respectively.  Super Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks (SRGAN) to improve the resolution of MRI reports and read the descriptions more precisely. This data is used to build a real time analytics dashboard using streamlit to monitor the key indicators.This pre-processed data from multi media EHRs is then passed through GPT 3.5 to convert extracted features to descriptions. These descriptions are converted into insightful summaries by the pretrained Transformer (T5) LLM Model built on Intel Developer Cloud and deployed in Hugging Face. The fetched summaries help the frontline medical workers to provide immediate assistance and make informed decisions in cases of unresponsive emergencies and unaccompanied senior patients with limited resources of medical history. 

Using the EHR data and summaries we detect and classify the health records into acute and chronic diseases using GPT 3.5 (Gen AI). Upon detection, relevant and optimized insurance programs are suggested and links are provided for enrollment into these programs, providing and enabling quality medical care. In future, we plan to take in consideration the patient's income and current savings  information to suggest the most effective and reasonable plan. This feature will not only help the hospital administration and patients but also enable insurance firms to curate programs that can provide desperate support to the deprived populations. This move is a strategic win-win scenario for all the stakeholders involved. 

Additionally to upscale the user experience we also provide a conversational chatbot built using Traversaal AI. This feature allows easy onboarding of hospital staff and ensure 24*7support to provide accurate support with utmost precision.
